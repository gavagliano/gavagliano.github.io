    <p>Surrounded by packed boxes that line the wall, I place my journal on the desk to write one last entry. I flick through the pages that whisper stories of the past. I approach the next blank page, but find myself unable to lift my pen. My phone lights up to tell me it is almost 12pm. I have 2 hours left until my mother arrives. To escape the eerie silence of this fractured house, I put on one last song of longing, “When the Sun Hits” by Slowdive. As soon as it plays, I rise out of my chair and surrender to the rhythm. I twirl my feet along the wooden floor and prance to the window to watch the trees match my movement, as if the song is choreographing us both. 
    </p>
    <p>The backyard appears the same after all of these years. The clouds stretch across the sky, reaching out to claim the spotlight stolen by the sun's radiant glow. As my eyes run down to the grass, I notice a man approaching the window. He transforms into a familiar face.
    </p>
    <p>The echo of his voice cuts through the song, “You know we have to leave soon, right?”
    </p>
    <p>“I want to play this song once more," my fragile attempt to extend the moment.
    </p>
    <p>“C’mon, we don’t have time.”
    </p>
    <p>“Then you can just leave. I’ll stay here.”
    </p>
    <p>With a tinge of frustration, he responds, “You’re never on time. You’re always difficult.”
    </p>
    <p>“Then leave.”
    </p>
    <p>I swiftly turn to my phone to rewind the song, the minutes waltzing away. 
        He comes back to the window.
        </p>
    <p>He says again, “You know we have to leave soon, right?”
    </p>
    <p>“I want to play this song once more.”
    </p>
    <p>“C’mon we don’t have time.”
    </p>
    <p>“Okay fine. I’ll meet you in the car, but-“
    </p>
    <p>A jarring ring shatters the delicate melody that had woven itself between the man and me. I glance down. “Mom” illuminates the screen. In the corner, “2:05” glares. 
    </p>
    <p>I quickly turn to grab my journal, leaving the man at the window. The blank pages stare at me. I take one last look outside and watch the scene morph into a curtain of rain and the man disappear from view. The music lingers as I rush to the doorway with my journal in hand. 
    </p>
    <p>I swing the door shut, a final note in this symphony.
