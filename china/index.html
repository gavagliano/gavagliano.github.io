        <h2>Beginnings of a Trade War</h2>
        <p>China and the United States have the world’s largest economies. For the past two years, there have been increased tensions between the two countries over allegations that China has failed to meet its WTO commitments. The U.S. declared that the Chinese government is giving unfair advantages to Chinese state-owned companies and is restricting foreign investment. The Washington Post said, “Studies have shown that Chinese exports led to lower prices for U.S. consumers…the country’s [China’s] ascent also resulted in the loss of millions of U.S. factory jobs. China’s power is now at a point where it risks eroding American military and economic advantages” {Curran}. 
        </p>
        <p>Since early 2018, President Trump has imposed three rounds of Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports and encouraged companies to move production out of China. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. imports. A UN report found that exports of Chinese goods hit by the tariffs dropped 25% in the first half of 2019. In the same period, Taiwan and South Korea saw sales of electronics increase, as China’s main exports to the U.S. include computers, telephones, video displays, and various electrical machinery parts (OEC). The U.S. and China reached a “Phase One” deal in January 2020 that slightly eased tensions, as the U.S. agreed to cut its tariffs in half while China agreed to increase its purchases of U.S. farm, energy, and manufactured products. However, this ceasefire was short-lived, as the coronavirus pandemic severely hit the U.S. only two months after.

        <h2>Virus Implications</h2>
        <p>The current coronavirus pandemic is having a larger impact on U.S.-China relations than the “tariff war”. Mutual blame over the pandemic has reignited tensions and has spread fear about the future of the global economy. The pandemic has interrupted any further trade discussions, as Trump has become more unwilling to negotiate and more inclined to impose tariffs as punishment for the pandemic. China and the U.S. represent 40% of the global market. Tariff escalation could disrupt global supply chains and hurt overall global economic recovery. According to Bloomberg Economics, the world economy could lose $1.2 trillion of output by 2021 if the trade war escalates. However, instead of a tariff war, the U.S. and China have turned to a technology competition that has become the modern-day space race. </p>
        <p>In May 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huwaei Technologies - a privately held Chinese firm and the world’s largest telecom-equipment maker - from manufacturing and obtaining semiconductor chips using American-made software and technology {Kapadia}. This move prevents Huwaei’s ability to work with its suppliers and advance its 5G capabilities. U.S. Attorney General William Barr described China’s dominance of 5G networks as one of the top U.S. national security and economic threats.
        </p>
        <p>No country reaches China in terms of its 5G capabilities, which can now power smart grids, self-driving cars, and autonomous weapons. Barron’s stated, “During the pandemic, China used 5G infrastructure to power robotic ultrasounds for patients and driverless vans to clean the streets of Wuhan” {Kapadia}. Communications, artificial intelligence, and data will shape the upcoming decades, and no country wants to fall behind. The United States’ objective to curtail China’s 5G development will slow innovation globally, as both nations aim to become more self-sufficient. 
        </p>
        <h2>Impact on Global Economy</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-with-space">China and the United States’ bilateral relationship is the most important economic relationship in the world. Tariffs affect numerous other countries and damage global economic integration. Both the pandemic and the trade war between the U.S. and China could lead companies towards a more domestic approach with production and sourcing, which would result in a reduction of global trade and a possible global recession. In addition, a trade war would inhibit development of artificial intelligence and 5G mobile networks. Cooperation in dealing with the coronavirus could ease many tense areas of the bilateral relationship and contribute to improving global economic stability.
